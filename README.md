# Unity3D-Open-Source-AI-and-Procedural-Generation



The build4_Data folder and the build4 executable together make up the functioning build of our game as seen on Demo Day.  It's meant to serve as an example of what you can do using our framework.  To use this, download the build4 executable and the build4_Data folder and put them in the same directory.  Run build4.exe to play.


The src folder contains just the code that we used in this project, organized by what we wrote it for and whether we got it from an outside source.  


The Prototype archive contains a buildable Unity project folder, complete with the scenes, art assets, and the code in the src folder. Extracting everything in this archive and opening the Prototype folder in Unity 5.6 or later gives you access to everything that we had working on the game.  Be sure to include all three scenes in Build Settings before building your own executable.
